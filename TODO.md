* Need to add documentation and examples for embeddings.
* Constructor / call options in all places need to be cascading, with defaults set on the constructor and being switched out or modified on api query. Possibly with a callback predicate to modify the opts on the fly.
* I have skipped various tests (marked with .skip).. these are failing because the URL is dependent on the config, and PollyJS is not re-playing the recordings since it cannot match them. These need to be fixed.

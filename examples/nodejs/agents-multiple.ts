/*
This is a more advanced example of a functional agent script that generates tweets about climate change. 
The script uses three agents: a writer agent, an evaluator agent, and a re-writer agent.

* The `writeTweet` agent generates tweets about climate change, 
* The `shouldImprove` agent evaluates the tweets based on specific criteria.
* The `rewriteTwetet` agent rewrites the tweet if a tweet needs improvement, based on the evaluator's feedback.

The script continues this process until all tweets meet the required criteria.

Tweet: Climate change is not a hoax. It is a real and urgent threat to our planet. We need to take action now to protect our environment and future generations. #ClimateChange #ActOnClimate üåçüåøüåû
Tweet at index 0 needs improvement.
Feedback: The tweet is informative and highlights the seriousness of climate change but it is not humor-based which is one of the criteria. The tweet should ideally contain a funny or light-hearted mention related to climate change that is also thought-provoking and engaging for readers..
Evaluating tweet at index 1.
Tweet: Climate change is not a problem for future generations to solve - it is happening now. We need to take action to reduce our carbon footprint and protect the planet for future generations. #climatechange #ActNow
Tweet at index 1 is good.
Evaluating tweet at index 2.
Tweet: Climate change is real and it's happening now. We need to take action to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. #ActOnClimate #ClimateChangeAwareness üåçüåø
Tweet at index 2 needs improvement.
Feedback: While the tweet does address climate change, it lack the funny tone that we are looking for. It is also a bit generic and lacks originality..

/**
 * This example demonstrates how to build a simple agent that increments a number automatically.
 * This is a very simple example, but the principles can be applied to more complex agents.
 * 
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
 * The current number is 1.
 * The current number is 2.
 * The current number is 3.
 * The current number is 4.
 * The current number is 5.
 * The current number is 6.
 * The current number is 7.
 * The current number is 8.
 * The current number is 9.
 * The current number is 10.
 * The agent has reached the stop condition.

                The user will state that "The current number is X". Output "The current number is X+1". Examples:

                User: The current number is 3.
                AI: The current number is 4.

                // If the user input is malformed
                User: The current number is 
                AI: The current number is 1.

                User: 
                AI: The current number is 1.

                // If the user input is not a number
                User: The current number is yellow.
                AI: The current number is 1.
